### 19.0.3.0.0

- feat(drims): allocate stock per source warehouse. The Allocate Stock wizard now auto-splits each requested line across the DRIMS warehouses that hold stock (e.g. 70 → 50 @ WH1 + 20 @ WH2) with editable rows; the split is captured on a new per-warehouse allocation record, shown on the request's Allocations tab and summarised in a "Source Warehouse(s)" column on the Requests list; dispatch creates one picking per source warehouse. The single "Source Warehouse" field on the request has been removed — the warehouse(s) are chosen in the wizard (#1079)
- feat(drims): Requests review UI/UX overhaul — post-approval fulfillment lanes, allocation shortfall indicators, and a destination-type selector (#1075)

### 19.0.2.0.0

- Initial migration to OpenSPP2
