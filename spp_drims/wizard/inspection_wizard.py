DRIMS Donation Inspection Wizard (DON-002)

Inline-editable single-screen flow:
- Operator sets Condition and Action directly on each row.
- "+ Add split" creates a child row under the parent product for mixed conditions.
- Parent qty mirrors the running sum of child rows; the parent itself carries no
  condition / action — those live on the children.
